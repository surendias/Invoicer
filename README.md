# Invoicer
Invoicer is a free invoicing tool created by myself aimed at freelancers

Invoicer is basically two parts.
1. Frontend with a simple form and javascript functions.
2. Backend with pdf generating capabilities.

One thing to note is Invoicer is hosted on Google App Engine. If you want to learn how to host your own version on Google App Engine I have created this tutorial with step by step instructions on how to do so.

Also note that if you wish to host this source in App Engine, please make necessary changes in app.yaml in order to reflect your project details.

This app is not saving any information at the moment. 

Future plans,

1. add login facility. With Google+ and Facebook Login capability.
2. Save customer information, invoice information and job information.
3. Create estimates.
4. Format the invoice.

The first version is available for use on http://invoicer.surendias.com
